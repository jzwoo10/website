    <h3>Nice Bus Dog</h3>
    <img src="nicebusdog.jpg">
    <p>This is literally the nicest looking dog I have ever seen. I mean in terms of personality.</p>
    <h3>Purse Puppy</h3>
    <img src="pursepuppy.jpg">
    <p>This puppy was spotted yesterday afternoon in the Ferry Building being calmly carried in his owner's crossbody bag.</p>
    <h3>Bus Chihuahua: The Dichotomy of Dog(?)</h3>
    <img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/white-chihuahua-3-years-old-9893812.jpg">
    <ul>
      <li><h4>Castro hippie man: </h4>
        <p>This was one of the best things I have seen in SF so far. 
        This man in True Religion jeans and a gray graphic zip-up, like something you would have found in Abercombie & Fitch in the 2010s, dressed like he was 20 but probably in his 60-70s sat down on the seat in front of me with a book and his dog in a sweater. 
        He took out these reading spectacles and read the whole trip, his little white chihuahua in a patterned sweater sitting calmly on his lap. 
        Other people looked and him and couldn't help smiling too. I wanted to take a photo but didn't want to be creepy. 
        Either way the vibes were immaculate.</p>
      </li>
      <li><h4>Scared and Agitated: </h4> 
        <p>This one was the polar opposite. The first time I have seen an agitated, non-calm dog on the Muni. 
          When he/she wasn't looking scared they were growling. I hope they found peace.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3-month-old Corgi</h3>
    <img src="https://myfavcorgi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-to-buy-a-corgi-the-ultimate-guide.jpg">
    <p>This was the first-ever SF dog I got to pet, and it'll also be the last because contact forms ATTACHMENT.
       Once I touched that tiny dog we formed a bond.</p>
